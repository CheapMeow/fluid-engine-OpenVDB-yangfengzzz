//! \brief Abstract base class for 3-D grid-based pressure solver.
//!
//! This class represents a 3-D grid-based pressure solver interface which can
//! be used as a sub-step of GridFluidSolver3. Inheriting classes must implement
//! the core GridPressureSolver3::solve function as well as the helper function
//! GridPressureSolver3::suggestedBoundaryConditionSolver.
//!

    //!
    //! \brief Solves the pressure term and apply it to the velocity field.
    //!
    //! This function takes input velocity field and outputs pressure-applied
    //! velocity field. It also accepts extra arguments such as \p boundarySdf
    //! and \p fluidSdf that represent signed-distance representation of the
    //! boundary and fluid area. The negative region of \p boundarySdf means
    //! it is occupied by solid object. Also, the positive / negative area of
    //! the \p fluidSdf means it is occupied by fluid / atmosphere. If not
    //! specified, constant scalar field with kMaxD will be used for
    //! \p boundarySdf meaning that no boundary at all. Similarly, a constant
    //! field with -kMaxD will be used for \p fluidSdf which means it's fully
    //! occupied with fluid without any atmosphere.
    //!
    //! \param[in]    input                 The input velocity field.
    //! \param[in]    timeIntervalInSeconds The time interval for the sim.
    //! \param[out]   output                The output velocity field.
    //! \param[in]    boundarySdf           The SDF of the boundary.
    //! \param[in]    fluidSdf              The SDF of the fluid/atmosphere.
